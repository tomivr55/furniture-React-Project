## How to use the project

The project is a forum containing various furniture-related publications. Each post can contain comments. Guests on the site have access to all posts, and all they can do is browse them and read the comments already written/if any. In order to add new posts, the guest must be registered and logged in. He is then able to write comments under other posts and of course under his own, as well as create his own topics, edit and delete them. Each logged-in user has access to a page containing information about his profile. The site also has a search engine that is accessible to everyone.
